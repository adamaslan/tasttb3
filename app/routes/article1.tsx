This works if you already have smaller bullets, but doesn&apos;t work for the larger bullets.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Delete the smaller bullet and make sure the cursor is all the way to the left.</strong><br />When you position the cursor at this point you are setting up the document to insert larger bullets.<br />*Note: If you have text already it will be left of the other bullets.</p>
